# Selena Agna, Canoness (6300 ip/975 rp)

## Abilities:

### Innate: Martyr’s Gift

#### Effect

If killed by a champion, if, in the next 10 seconds, an allied champion kills her killer, he will gain additional gold equal to 50% of how much the enemy got for killing her.

### Q: Holy Repentance

#### Effect

Passive: Your autoattacks leave a debuff (`Repentance`) on enemies, for `5 seconds`. `Repentance` slows enemies for `5% to 15%` depending on how close they are to you (`5%` at `500 range`, `15%` at `100 range`), and lasts `4 seconds`.  
Active: Deals `50/80/120/160/200 (+0.2 times ability power)` to enemies in a circle. Targets hit by this will have `Repentance` refreshed on them if they had it, and will be afflicted with `Emperor's Light` for `2 seconds`. `Emperor's Light` makes one Canoness's melee attack on that target guaranteed to critically hit. 

#### Cost: 80 mana

#### Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 seconds

#### Range: 450

### W: Holy Retribution

#### Effect

Cast on a group of friendly units to make attacks against them do `6/18/30/42/54 (+0.1 times ability power) magic damage` to the attacker for `5 seconds`. Does not work against towers, and only triggers if said ally actually took damage.

### Ultimate: Martyrdom

#### Effect
