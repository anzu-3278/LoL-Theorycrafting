### Q: Soul Draw (toggle)

#### Effect

Enemies within `700 range` take damage equal to `0.5% (+0.1% for every 100 ability power)` of their max health every second. The psyker is healed for half of the damage done by this ability, and allies in range for half of that.

#### Cost: 10/9/8/7/6 mana per second (+ 50% per target)

#### Cooldown: toggle

#### Range: 700

### W: Psychic Grip

#### Effect

Silences the target for `2 seconds`, slowing their movement speed by `25%` and begins to channel, doing `75/100/150/200/250 (+0.7 per ability power) over 2 seconds`, while the target is in range (`500`).

#### Cost: 50/80/110/140/170 mana

#### Cooldown: 11/10.5/10/9.5/9 seconds

#### Range: 500

### W: Dislocate

If `Psychic Grip` finishes, Alaric can, for `4 seconds`, use `Dislocate` to place the target anywhere in front of him, within the ability's range.

#### Cost: 65% of the cost of Psychic Grip

#### Range: 500

### E: Touch of Disturbance

#### Effect

Passive: Basic attacks deal 3/3.5/4/4.5/5% of your max mana in magic damage.
Active: The next basic attack will deal 60% of your ability power in magic damage.

#### Cost: 65/75/85/95/110 mana

#### Cooldown: 9 times the time between attacks. Not affected by Cooldown Reduction.

### Ultimate: Touch of Insanity

#### Effect

Breaks the bonds of sanity, allowing him inhuman power for a short time. For `8 seconds`, your attack damage and ability power are increased by `10/15/20%`, your attack range is increased by `200`, and the cooldown of `Touch of Disturbance` is reduced to `6 times the time between attacks`.

#### Cost: 150/200/250 mana

#### Cooldown: 130/120/110 seconds after it ends

### Ultimate: Despair

#### Effect

While `Touch of Insanity` is active, you can use `Despair`. `Despair` deals `100/150/200 (+0.3 times ability power)` damage to a target, `penetrating 45% of all magic resistance`. It also afflicts them with `Despair` for `2 seconds`, a debuff which slows their movement speed by `15%` and decreases the damage taken from Despair by `5%`, stacking `4` times.

#### Cost: 80 mana

#### Cooldown: 1.2 seconds

#### Range: Not specified in the original design
