# Anzu, the Twin Essence (6300 ip/975 rp)

## Abilities:

### Innate: Battle Trance

#### Effect

After attacking a target 7 times in a row (3 for champions) with a basic attack (spells don't count), Anzu enters a `Battle Trance`. `Battle Trance` lasts 4 seconds, is refreshed when attacking, grants Anzu `20 movement speed` and empowers his melee attacks. Every other attack will strike again for `75% base attack damage` and every fifth will suppress the target for `0.25 seconds` while dealing `125% attack damage` over five swift hits. Both of these apply on-hit effects.

### Q: Illusion

#### Effect

Lights up a target area (`200` x `100`), providing LoS to you and impairing it to the enemy. In the next `3 seconds`, Anzu can use the ability to teleport there, striking the nearest unit three times swiftly. These attacks do an additional `15/25/35/45/55 physical damage` each. If a champion is struck, all of Anzu's cooldowns are reduced by `2 seconds`.

#### Cost: 30/45/60/75/90 mana

#### Cooldown: 8 seconds

#### Range: 475

### W: Dark Essence/Sange

#### Effect

Deals `70/120/170/220/270 (+0.6 per ability power) magic damage` to enemies in a cone, silencing them for `1.4 seconds` (`Dark Essence`).

After using `Dark Essence`, for `5 seconds`, Anzu can use `Sange`, unless he has used `Light Essence` in that time. `Sange` deals `6% of the target's max health in true damage` and silences them for `2 seconds` (`Sange`). Can only be used on targets afflicted with `Dark Essence`.

If a target afflicted with one `essence` becomes the target of another, they will lose both impairing effects and will take `20% of the damage of both spells in true damage`. The impairing effects of `Sange` and `Yasha` cannot be consumed like this.
