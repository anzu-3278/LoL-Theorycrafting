Taking damage gives the Harlequin hate, 2 points for every 1% of her maximum health lost. Hate is capped at 100, and fades at a rate of 5 every 2 seconds after 10 seconds out of combat. You gain 1% lifesteal for 4 points of Hate.

### Q: Harlequin's Kiss

#### Effect

You stealth for `2 seconds`. Any damage taken or done in stealth will break it.  
If you attack a champion from stealth, the attack will deal `150(+2 per Hate, up to 50)%` bonus damage. If the target dies, you will stealth again for `1.75 seconds`, and enemies within `200 range` of the target will take `(2 per Hate, up to 50)%` of your weapon damage.  
Hate is consumed for the initial attack, but not for the splash.
